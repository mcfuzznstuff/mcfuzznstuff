## Background

This is my "professional" GitHub account, as access to my ["college" GitHub account](https://github.com/stephanieMiranda) has been proving difficult to access. Please check out my LinkedIn, UpWork, and personal site for more details about me and what I do as both a Freelance Web Developer and Professional Product Owner.

This account is being used to keep some of my skills fresh as I dive deeper into Product Ownership/Management roles and freelance clients. This will provide me with a solid place to test out ideas, skills, and other Software Engineering skills that I no longer use on a daily basis.
