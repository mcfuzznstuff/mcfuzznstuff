## Background

This is my "professional" GitHub account, as access to my ["college" GitHub account](https://github.com/stephanieMiranda) has been proving difficult to access. Please check out my LinkedIn, UpWork, and personal site for more details about me and what I do as both a Freelance Web Developer and Professional Product Owner.
